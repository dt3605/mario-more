# Mario More

This is the second project of the CS50x course.  
The goal is to recreate a half-pyramid similar to the one in the classic Mario game.  

This version has been adapted to run **without** the CS50 library, so anyone can compile and run it using only a standard C compiler.

## What it does

- Prints a half-pyramid of hashes (`#`) on the screen
- The height of the pyramid is specified by the user (between 1 and 8)
- Uses loops and conditionals to build the pyramid

## How to use

1. Compile the code with `make mario-more`
2. Run the program with `./mario-more`
3. Enter a height between 1 and 8 when prompted

## About

This project helps practice basic programming concepts in C, including loops, user input, and conditionals.
